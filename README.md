# Getting Started
Visual Studio 2017 or 2019 is recommended, Blaze is officially untested on other development environments whilst we focus on a Windows build.

You can clone the repository to a local destination using git:

git clone --recursive https://github.com/RyuuSlayer/Blaze3D

Make sure that you do a --recursive clone to fetch all of the submodules!

# The Plan
The plan for Blaze is two-fold: to create a powerful 3D engine, but also to serve as an experimental tool for VR, AR and other experimental Features.

# Main features to come:
Fast 2D rendering (UI, particles, sprites, etc.)
High-fidelity Physically-Based 3D rendering (this will be expanded later, 2D to come first)
Support for Mac, Linux, Android and iOS
Native rendering API support (DirectX, Vulkan, Metal)
Fully featured viewer and editor applications
Fully scripted interaction and behavior
Integrated 3rd party 2D and 3D physics engine
Procedural terrain and world generation
Artificial Intelligence
Audio system
Virtual Reality
Augemented Reality
